          <p>
            Over the course of the last two years, I have had the ample
            privilege to go from a novice to becoming a designer with a
            high-level understanding of design and its principles. I have also
            had the rare privilege to rise quickly in my career journey such
            that I have now designed in environments that required the close
            collaboration of all design stakeholders; business owners, C-level
            officers, software developers, and other designers like myself.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            So the scope of this class will extend beyond book knowledge but
            will aim to teach you practical everyday design approaches, that
            will allow you to establish yourself as a competent designer in any
            room you find yourself within a year. This class will also afford
            you the growth pad to transcend to career heights at unprecedented
            speeds.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-6 lg:mt-12 font-bold text-xl lg:text-5xl text-sonSilver">
            My name is John Okor and I have 2 years of useful design experience
            building digital products.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            Designing and building digital products is what I do every day;
            sometimes even on Sundays. I love what I do and I am extremely good
            at it. I am also an extremely good teacher, but l will let you be
            the judge of that….
          </p>

          <p class="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            The underlying question to be answered is, what is in it for me?
            What do I stand to actually gain from this tutoring exercise?
            Because organizing a class of this magnitude is stressful and the
            outcome will not make me rich….
          </p>

          <p class="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            Simply put, I want to have raised 10 competent well rounded UI and
            UX designers by January 2024. So this is very personal for me, I am
            more interested in your growth than you presently are.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            Secondly, I like to think of myself as a very good user experience
            designer and I would like to teach as many as would like to learn,
            practical thinking frameworks that ultimately result in great
            products.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-6 lg:mt-12 font-bold text-xl lg:text-5xl">
            Essentially I just want to teach you how to think.
